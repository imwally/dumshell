# dumshell
The dumb shell that dumps information about the current UNIX process. Seriously, this is a dumb shell. Don't use it.

I started reading [APUE](http://www.apuebook.com/) and wanted to get a feel for how UNIX processes fork and exec from another parent process. The code is mostly identical to the example taken from Figure 1.10 of Chapter 1.
